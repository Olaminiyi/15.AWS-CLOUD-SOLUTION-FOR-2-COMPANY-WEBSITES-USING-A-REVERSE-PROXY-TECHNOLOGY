# 15.AWS-CLOUD-SOLUTION-FOR-2-COMPANY-WEBSITES-USING-A-REVERSE-PROXY-TECHNOLOGY

We will build a secure infrastructure inside AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network for **ACS** Company that uses WordPress CMS for its main business website, and a [Tooling](https://github.com/Olaminiyi/tooling) website for the DevOps team.

As part of the companyâ€™s desire for improved security and performance, a decision has been made to use a reverse proxy technology from **NGINX** to achieve this.

**PURPOSE:**

Reduced Cost, increase Security and Scalability are the major requirements for this project. Hence, implementing the architecture designed below, ensure that infrastructure for both websites (WordPress and Tooling) are resilient to Web Server failures, can accomodate increased traffic and at the same time, has reasonable cost.

**AWS resources Required for the Design:**

- North Virginia Region (us-east-1)
- Availibility zones (3 subnets in us-east-1a) and (3 subnets in us-east-1b)
- VPC Network Range - 10.0.0.0/16
- subnets - 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24, 10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24, 10.0.5.0/24 and 10.0.6.0/24
- 6 subnets (4 private subnets and 2 public subnets)
- internet gateway
- 2 nginx for reverse proxy
- 2 bastion hosts/jump servers
- 2 application Load balancers(ALB)
- Auto scaling Groups to manage the scaling of the Ec2 instances
- 2 NAT gateways for the resources in the private subnet to communicate with the internet gateway.

> [!NOTE]
> The NAT gateway only allows traffic to the internet and does not allow from the internet.

- Route DNS
- RDS for the database
- Amazon Elastic Files System for the file management

**AWS MULTIPLE WEBSITE PROJECT**

Firstly fork https://github.com/Olaminiyi/ACS-project-config.git into your repo

### SET UP A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK (VPC)

**Go to AWS console**
We are creating 2 `route tables`, the First will talk to the public subnet via `internet gateway` WHILE the SECOND will talk to `private subnet` via the `Natgateway`

**Create a new VPC**
Name it ACS-VPC
From the soluton diagram: IPv6 CIDR block : 10.0.0.0/16

![alt text](images/15.1.png)

![alt text](images/15.2.png)

We need to enable the DNS hostname, the DNS resolution is enabled already
From actions > edit VPC settings
 
![alt text](images/15.3.png)

Check enable and save changes
       
![alt text](images/15.4.png)

    

### Create internet gateway and attach to VPC

Click on the Internet gateway

![alt text](images/15.5.png)
     
Create, name it ACS-Igw
 
![alt text](images/15.6.png)

Click on Action > attach to VPC
   
![alt text](images/15.7.png)
  
Select our own VPC > Attach internet gateway
     
![alt text](images/15.8.png)
    
### The next thing to create is the Subnet

To divide ip address check: ipinfo.io/ips
Our /16 is under 0/8, were are going to set set even number to public subnet and odd number to private subnet
Click on  creat subnet
From the diagram, there are 2 subnet and 2 availablity zones. the load balancer (ALB) needs two zones to function
For this project, we are using AZ  us-eas-t1a and us-east-1b
select our pvc

![alt text](images/15.9.png)

Named it ACS-public-subnet-1
select us-east-1a
The CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/24
 
![alt text](images/15.10.png)

**Add new subnet**
ACS-public-subnet-2
select us-east-1b
10.0.2.0/24
Click on create subnet
 
![alt text](images/15.11.png)

**For the second subnet**
create the private subnet
select our pvc
ACS-private-subnet-1
us-east-1a
10.0.1.0/24

![alt text](images/15.12.png)

**Add new subnet**
ACS-private-subnet-2
us-east-1b
10.0.3.0/24

![alt text](images/15.13.png)

**for the third subnet**
ACS-private-subnet-3
us-east-1a
10.0.5.0/24

![alt text](images/15.14.png)

**Add new subnet**
ACS-private-subnet-4
us-east-1b
10.0.7.0/24

![alt text](images/15.15.png)

All created subnets
 
![alt text](images/15.19.png)

### Next is to create the Route Table

We are creating 2 route table
Click on the route table link
The first one: ACS-public-rtb
Select the VPC > create
 
![alt text](images/15.16.png)

The second one: ACS-private-rtb
Select the VPC > create
 
![alt text](images/15.17.png)
![alt text](images/15.18.png)

### Next is to associate the public subnet to the public route tabe and vice-versa

Click on the ACS-public-rtb
Click on subnet asscoiation > edit subnet associations
 
![alt text](images/15.20.png)

Select public subnet1 & 2
Click on save association

![alt text](images/15.21.png)

Do the same for ACS-private-rtb

![alt text](images/15.22.png)

### Next is to edit the route of the route table

We want the the Route table to have access to the subnets
Click on Route table > Public Route > 
Action > Edit Route 

![alt text](images/15.23.png)

Click on Add route
Let it have access to the internet by open it to 0.0.0/0
Select INTERNET GATEWAY > select the created internet gateway > save changes

![alt text](images/15.24.png)

This implies that every subnet associated to this Route Table is going to talk to the internet via this internet gateway
Internet gateway is a 2 way communication; the internet can talk to the subnet and the subnet can talk to the internet
UNLIKE the NATGATEWAY, the subnet can talk internet but the internet can not talk to the subnet

The next step is to create the Natgateway to be attached to the Private subnets but we need to create ELASTIC IP to be attached to the Natgateway first
Click on elastic IP > allocate Elastic IP
 
![alt text](images/15.25.png)
    
Name it ACS-NAT > Allocate

![alt text](images/15.26.png)

![alt text](images/15.27.png)

Note that if you allocate an `Elastip IP` without attaching it to a resources you get charged but if you associate to a resources you won't get charged

### Next step is to create NAT Gateway
    
Click on Nat gateway > create a Natgateway

![alt text](images/15.28.png)

Name it (ACS-natgateway)
Natgate must be placed in PUBLIC
      
![alt text](images/15.29.png)

Placed it in ACS-public-subnet-1
Placed it in elastic IP created > Create
 
![alt text](images/15.30.png)

Lets go back to our route table
Rememer we connecting to `NAT GATEWAY` here because it is Private (unlike the public Public route that can communicate 2 ways with internet gateway)
       
Click on Route table > Private Route
Action > Edit Route 
 
![alt text](images/15.31.png)

Click on Add route
let it have access to the internet by open it to 0.0.0/0
select NAT GATEWAY > select the created Nat gateway > save changes

![alt text](images/15.32.png)

The next step is to create the security group 
we will creat security group for the application load balancer and the resources we have
The first security group is for the external load balancer
Under Security > Security group > create security group

![alt text](images/15.33.png)

Named it ACS-ext-ALB > Descrip(for ext ALB)
Select the ACS-VPC
 
![alt text](images/15.34.png)

### EDIT THE INBOUND RULES

For the external ALB, we want it to be accessible on the internet from anywhere
give it both HTTPS and HTTP from anywhere 0.0.0.0/0

![alt text](images/15.35.png)

**FOR OUTBOUND RULES**
Allow all trafic from 0.0.0.0/0
for tags you can put ACS-ext-ALB 
Create security group
  
![alt text](images/15.36.png)
        
The next security group is the bastion security group
click security group
Named it ACS-bastion > Descrip(for bastion)
select the ACS-VPC

![alt text](images/15.37.png)

**EDIT THE INBOUND RULES**
we need ssh for our bastion, and only from our computer IP
open ssh from (sorce = My IP)
add description
that's all we need for bastion > create Security group

![alt text](images/15.38.png)

### The next security group is for the reverse proxy servers (NGINX servers)
Create security group
named (ACS-nginx-reverse-proxy) > select VPC

![alt text](images/15.41.png)
 
![alt text](images/15.39.png)

from the diagram, for the reverse proxy (nginx) is placed directly under the ALB. the source of traffic should only come from the ALB (not from the internet nor our IP)

**EDIT INBOUND RULES**
HTTP from the ALB security group
HTTPS from the ALB security group
we need our bastion to have access to our reverse proxy server in case of any issue, we should be able to ssh into our reverse proxy server from our bastion
SSH from the bastion security group 

![alt text](images/15.40.png)

![alt text](images/15.42.png)

**OUTBOUND RULES** is ok for all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0
Create group

The next security group is for the internal load balancer
Under Security > Security group > create security group
Named it ACS-int-ALB > Descrip(for int ALB)
Select the ACS-VPC
 
![alt text](images/15.43.png)

**EDIT THE INBOUND RULES** 
NOTE from the diagram, the traffic is coming only from the Nginx server
Both HTTPS and HTTP from nginx security group
nothing for the outbound rules 
create security

![alt text](images/15.44.png)
        
The next security group we are creating now is for the webservers
The source of its traffic is coming only from the internal ALB
Named it ACS-weberver > Descrip(for webserev)
Select the ACS-VPC
 
 ![alt text](images/15.45.png)

**EDIT INBOUND RULES**

ssh access only via the bastion security group
HTTP and HTTPS from the internal ALB security group
**Create**

![alt text](images/15.46.png)
        
The next security group we are creating is for the data layer
For the data layer, our webserver needs to be mounts to the Amazon Elastic Filesystem and conneted to the RDS database
Also our bastion needs access to the database
Named it ACS-datalayer > Descrip(for datalayer)
select the ACS-VPC

![alt text](images/15.47.png)

**EDIT INBOUND RULES**
`mysql` access only via the `baston security group`, we need mysql access into the RDS to create `database`.
`NFS` access through the `webserver security group`
`mysql/aurora` access through the `webserver security group`
Create
     
![alt text](images/15.48.png)

After creating all the security groups, the next is to create the certificate, the amazon file system and then the RDS

Got a domain name `olami.uk`from 123Reg and transfer it to Route53 on aws

![alt text](images/15.53.png)

Create a hosted name in the `Route 53` with the registered domain name 
    
![alt text](images/15.54.png)

**Created hosted zone**
Put the domain name (olami.uk) > choose public hosted zone
 
![alt text](images/15.55.png)

![alt text](images/15.97.png)
    
Go to the domain name provider and `edit` the `nameservers`
Transfer the (4 server address) in the hostname zone in the (NS column) to the domain provider nameservers

![alt text](images/15.56.png)

The next step is to get a certificate from **AWS Certificate Manager**
The reason we are creating a `certificate`first is because when creating `ALB` we need to select a `certificate`
Click on request a Cert > Request public cert > Next
 
![alt text](images/15.49.png)
 
![alt text](images/15.50.png)
  
In the domain name, we are going to use a **wild card i.e(*.)**
should in case we want to have another `name` or `subdomain`, the `WILDCARD` will make sure that any name before the domain name is attached to the `certificate`. e.g **temi.olami.uk**

put this for domain name: `*.olami.uk`
chose DNS validation > 
        
 ![alt text](images/15.51.png)

Key Algorithm : RSA 2048
for name or tags: ACS-cert > Review > confirm

![alt text](images/15.52.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Because we are using DNS verification is going to automatically write to the Rout53 to confirm
   
click on create records in Route53

![alt text](images/15.57.png)

> [!NOTE] 
> The verification maybe pending for a while but will be issued after confirmation
  
![alt text](images/15.98.png)

Certificate will be attched to ALB

### The next service to create is Elastic file system
       
Go to amazon file system service > create file system
name: ACS-filesystem
select PVC

![alt text](images/15.59.png)

Regional
click on customize > Next

![alt text](images/15.60.png)

![alt text](images/15.61.png)

![alt text](images/15.62.png)

We want to add mount target to our filesystem which simply means specifying the subnet
Any resources in the subnet we specify will be able to mount on the file system 
From the diagram we can se that the webservers that want to ount on the file system and in `private subnet 1 & 2`

If we mistakenly put file system in `private subnet 3 & 4`that means our webserver will not be able to mount on the file system because we have not created `mount target` in their subnet

so chose private subnet 1 for us-east-1a
chose private subnet 2 for us-east-1b

For the security group; chose ACS-datalayer for both > next > create
     
![alt text](images/15.63.png)

![alt text](images/15.64.png)

The next thing we are going to create is access point for the file system
Access point is what we specified for servers to mount with
we are creating 2 access point, one for `wordpress` and `Tooling`
we are creating 2 access point so we don't have to mount 2 webservers on a single access point
if we do that, the files will overwrite each other and that will mess up our infrastructure
create Access point under `EFS service`
For file name: choose the already created "ACS-filesytem"
**For the first one; Name : wordpress for tag - wordpree-ap (access point)**
root directory: /wordpress

![alt text](images/15.65.png)

POSIX user; set it to the root user = 0
Group ID = 0
leave secondary empty

![alt text](images/15.66.png)

under Root directory creation permission
owner ID = 0
owner group ID = 0
for the POSIX permission, we want our file to be able to read & write
we set to 0755 > create access point

![alt text](images/15.67.png) 
            
**for the second one Tooling**
Name tooling
root directory: /tooling

![alt text](images/15.68.png)

POSIX user; set it to the root user = 0
Group ID = 0
leave secondary empty

![alt text](images/15.69.png)

under Root directory creation permission
owner ID = 0
owner group ID = 0
for the POSIX permission, we want our file to be able to read & write
we set to 0755 > create access point

![alt text](images/15.70.png)

![alt text](images/15.71.png)

### use the IAM service of the AWS to create a user

**create user >** 
    
![alt text](images/15.74.png)

Enter username and password > next > create a group
 
![alt text](images/15.75.png)

![alt text](images/15.76.png)

Name : user > assign permission policies > create user group
 
![alt text](images/15.77.png)

![alt text](images/15.78.png)

### Create KMS Key

To set up `RDS` we need to create `KMS key` to be used to `encrypt` the database instance
The next step is to create a KMS key in the KMS store
Go to [AWS Key Management service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)
create a key > Symmetric

![alt text](images/15.72.png)

click advance option, leave as default 
name : ACS-rds-key > next

![alt text](images/15.73.png)

key administartor: set myself > finish

![alt text](images/15.79.png)

![alt text](images/15.80.png)

### The next pre requsite is to create a subnet group
    
Go to Amazon RDS service
click on subnet group > Create DB subnet group

![alt text](images/15.81.png)

name: ACS-rds-subnet
chose VPC

![alt text](images/15.82.png)

chose AZ (us-east-1a) and (us-east1b)
**Remember fom the diagram, The RDS are in private subnet 3 and 4**.
**from our design we are using odd numbers for our private subnet**
Our RDS will take (10.0.5.0/24 and 10.0.7.0/24)
Choose the subnets > create
 
![alt text](images/15.83.png)

![alt text](images/15.84.png)

### Create Database

Go to dashboard > create database
standard > MySql >(MySQl 8.0.23)

![alt text](images/15.85.png)

**Choose free Tier**
 
![alt text](images/15.86.png)

![alt text](images/15.87.png)

name: ACS-database 
Master Username: change to ACSadmin 
password :admin12345

![alt text](images/15.88.png)
 
![alt text](images/15.89.png)

![alt text](images/15.90.png)

select VPC > the subnet will be automatically populated
public access : NO
       
![alt text](images/15.91.png)

        - VPC Security group: choose existing (ACS-datalayer)
        - AZ : you can choose between 1a or 1b
        - Database Authentication : Password authentication
        - initial database name: test
        - leave other settings as default > create
        ![alt text](images/15.92.png)
        ![alt text](images/15.93.png)

    # To create an autoscaling group we are going to need an AMI, launch template and a target group
    # A target group must be attached to a load balancer
    # we create a target group first, then a lauch template, after the we create the load balancer
    # After that we can create our autoscaling group such that it we make use of the lauch templated and load balancer we've created to spin up our instances
    # 2 things inside lauch template are the AMI and the user data

    # The first thing is to create an AMI first
    # we creating 3 AMI's for (bastion, Nginx and webservers)
        - spin up 3 RedHat EC2 instances for (bastion, Nginx and webservers)
     ![alt text](images/15.93.png)

    # The first installation is for the Bastion AMI
        - connect to the bastion server via ssh
        - change to super user : su -

        - using the installation.md file for installation
            - install the epel & remi repository

         ![alt text](images/15.100.png)

# The next installation is for the Nginx AMI
#  we will be configuring sellinux policiies for our nginx
# we will also install sel-signed certificate for our nginx because:
    - To configure our target group, we must ensure that the protocol HTTS on secure TLS port 443 i.e 
    - the load balancer will be sending traffic to both (nginx and webserver on port 443)
    - we must set the port that the nginx is listening to on port 443
    - for this configuration to be secured we must configured a self-signed certificate on (both nginx and webserver instances)
    - Our ALB already have a certficate from AWS manager that we created so our reverse proxy 
# check: tutoria for how to create a self-signed certificate for nginx, also Apache

        - connect to the nginx server via ssh
        - change to super user : sudo su -

# we can delete the instance we used to create the AMI (webserve, bastion and nginx) as we dont need them again
![alt text](images/15.213.png)

# The next step is to create the wordpressdb and toolingdb
# we are going to use the concept of ssh agent to achieve this 
    
    - go to EC2 dashboard > select ACS-bastion > copy the public IPv4 addresses
    ![alt text](images/15.214.png)

    - go to the terminal, add your public key with these commands
        ssh-add <your key>.pem
        ssh-add -l
![alt text](images/15.215.png)

    - ssh into your bastion with this command
       **** ssh -A ec2-user@<ACS-bastion-public-IPv4-address>   not yet
       - connect normally with public ip
    
    ## if the connection timed out, check the security group and change from my IP to anywhere

    -Let's get into the mysql, we used the RDS endponit as the host
        - Go to RDS > Databases > acs-database >connectivity & Security
        - copy the endpoint
 ![alt text](images/15.216.png)
        - mysql -h acs-database.cxgqmm0me4bb.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u ACSadmin -p

            - show databases;
    ![alt text](images/15.217.png)    
            - exit from the RDS and back to our bastion
